        Here goes the token factual account—keep reading for a more personal encounter with the wonderful weirdness that is me.<br>
        <br>
<em>An old, well-travelled soul, Mera has in her young life in this particular time on Earth already had the privilege of amassing a wealth of Light experiences as well as worldly accomplishments, including a degree in Psychology and Philosophy from the University of Oxford, multiple scholarships, and awards. She has also received training in various modalities, including Reiki, EFT, Psych-K, NLP, Akashic, Soul and Past Life work, and traditional coaching, all of which she integrates into her personal coaching style.</em><br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
It’s sometime around the millenium, I’m a young kid and realise I’m a bit of an oddball soul from somewhere far away, leading me to have very confusing episodes of going weeks without quite being sure what is reality and what is dream, feeling rather confused, lost and stranded. At the same time I have strange moments of perceiving the world with peculiar clarity and perspective, and being very sensitive to pain existing in my environment. Add to that family dramas like behind most people’s closed doors and little me makes an unconsious decision that she doesn’t really want to be here and take part in this world with so much fear and pain, and that the best way to protect herself and survive is to make herself small, go numb and avoid having to be properly alive and present. Also, whilst it’s unsafe to fully shine my Light, approval is important for love and reassurance, so I better do really really well constantly.<br>
<br>
It’s a couple years later, and I’m doing really really well constantly. Think best of the class, think student at one of the most prestigious professional ballet schools of the world, think scholarships, think going from year 10 straight to year 12, think graduating top of my country, and you get the picture. I’m also crying, racked with sobs, in my room on the floor, three times a week. There’s a successful girl the world gets to see, and there’s a me in there somewhere. <br>
<br>
I’m on vacation with a friend at a secluded locals' beach in Marseille, there in time to catch the sunset. My friend’s picked herself up a local, so I go into the water to enjoy the sunset from out there. I swim and keep swimming. It’s just me and the open ocean ahead of me. It feels much more like a place I belong than that world somewhere behind me. Still swimming out. And out. Tears streaming down my face. I don’t want to turn back, don’t want to go back there, where I feel I don’t belong, where I’m never really present. Something’s got to change. I won’t be not really alive any longer.<br>
<br>
I’m onto this thing called personal development and actively working with your energetic and spiritual gifts. It’s brilliant, I explore and grow and grow and grow. I’m also starting to tentatively introduce <em>me</em> to the world. Summer time comes around, second year at Oxford, and I really should go to foggy grey Edinburgh for the Edinburgh Fringe, but my gut screams at me ‘Get away from here! Far away!’. So I hop on a plane and off to Hawaii I go, with no arrangements, just a backpack, myself and my trust in my intuition to sort me out for the two months I plan on being out there, to keep searching.<br>
<br>
I’m a guest at Ischia Global Film Fest, rubbing shoulders with Helen Mirren and Antonio Banderas. I attend a masterclass and I stand on cold stone tiles in a sweaty room full of emotionally riled up people with my arms extended to my sides and Beyonce is blasting ‘I was here’ through the room. I start shaking. I break down and break through and find that god, yes, I want to be here, decide that from now on, I will be here, come ruin or rapture.<br>
<br>
It’s troves of beautiful manifestations, synchronicities and adventures later. I’m letting my Light bloom. I live my life like I mean it. I’m awake and present. I defy gravity. I’m me. I want to share the gift of Light with you.
