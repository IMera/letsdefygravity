          I help you discover what it means for you to live life like you mean it, to the fullest expression of yourself, and to make that juicy life your reality: Awake, sexy, defying gravity.<br>
          <br>
I do this by taking you on a deep sea dive – a highly effective coaching and transformation process: Deep level coaching, intuitively guided, energetically supported, personalised, uniting your powerful guiding centers mind, heart, and gut/body, and integrating various holistic and scientific techniques.<br>
<br>
I invite you to join me for your two-day destination intensive in a luxury location, allowing us to dive deep and effect massive change. You will leave transformed—or blossomed, as I like to call it—and with concrete actions to take away and implement so as to ground your Light bloom into your present and daily life. Every intensive includes three follow ups via phone/Skype for your continued support, and notes of our time together. <br>
<br>
By application, destination intensives are also available as a three-day cruise on a skippered atmospheric sailing yacht in the beautiful waters of the Turqoise Coast in the Mediterranean for a slightly more adventurous experience—as hands-on or hands-off as you desire.<br>
<br>
