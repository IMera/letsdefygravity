            Do you? Truly, deep down, looking past the amount of worldly success you have achieved?
            Maybe you really should be happy by anyone’s standards, but you are just... not.
            I dare you to face the shadows, leap, live life <em>off</em> the edge and ask yourself:
          </p>
          <p class='lead'>
What if you lived awake and sexy, to your fullest expression of yourself, living life like you mean it? What if you were in total presence, joy and authenticity? What if you really lived your dreams?  What if by doing all that you could actually help the planet? <br><br>
That’s what my coaching is all about. Let’s defy gravity.

      Coaching with me is for you if you resonate with any of these statements:
      
    </p>
      <ul>
      <li>You feel unfulfilled in any aspect of your life</li>
<li>You are looking to gain clarity on any aspect of your life</li>
<li>You feel lost or stuck</li>
<li>You don’t feel you are really being and living you</li>
<li>You want to lift yourself higher</li>
<li>You are looking for a way to be in service to the planet</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
    <p class='text-right'>
      Coaching with me is by referral or through application. <br>
      <br>
      My clients are high vibration individuals or those I affectionately call high vibration potentials and uniquees. This means that my clients tend to be one or more of the following:<br>
<br>
<ul class='text-right'>
  <li>already quite advanced/ high achievers/ do-it-themselves-ers</li>
      <li>awake, seeking, or questioning (it feels like coming out of the closet a lot of the time, let’s face it!)</li>
      <li>successful—as nebulous as that label is...</li>
      <li>oddballs (I’m a proud member of this family myself.)</li>
</ul>
</p>

Something has changed within me<br>
Something is not the same<br>
I'm through with playing by the rules<br>
Of someone else's game<br>
Too late for second-guessing<br>
Too late to go back to sleep<br>
It's time to trust my instincts<br>
Close my eyes and leap!<br>
It's time to try<br>
Defying gravity<br>
I think I'll try<br>
Defying gravity<br>
And you can't pull me down!<br>
So if you care to find me<br>
Look to the western sky!<br>
As someone told me lately:<br>
Everyone deserves the chance to fly!<br>
And if I'm flying solo<br>
At least I'm flying free<br>
To those who'd ground me<br>
Take a message back from me:<br>
Tell them how I'm<br>
Defying gravity<br>
I'm flying high<br>
Defying gravity!<br>

I wanna leave my footprint on the sands of time<br>
Know there was something that, meant something that I left behind<br>
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets,<br>
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget<br>
I was here<br>
I lived, I loved<br>
I was here<br>
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted<br>
And it was more than I thought it would be<br>
I will leave my mark so everyone will know<br>
I was here<br>
I want to say I lived each day, until I die<br>
And know that I meant something in somebody's life<br>
The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave<br>
That I made a difference, and this world will see<br>
I was here<br>
I lived, I loved<br>
I was here<br>
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted<br>
And it was more than I thought it would be<br>
I will leave my mark so everyone will know<br>
I just want them to know<br>
That I gave my all, did my best<br>
Brought someone to happiness<br>
Left this world a little better just because<br>
I was here<br>
